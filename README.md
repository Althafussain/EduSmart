# EduSmart Sri Lanka

EduSmart is a responsive Next.js App Router experience for Sri Lankan students. The first vertical slice is the student workspace and timed examination flow: personalized learning cards, upcoming exams, subject progress, an AI insight panel, and a usable exam modal with a live countdown and question navigation.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

Use the committed `.env.example` as a template for local variables. Keep real credentials in `.env`; it is ignored by Git.

## Validate

```bash
npm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run build
```

## Deploy to Vercel

1. Push this repository to GitHub and import `Althafussain/EduSmart` in Vercel. The repository root is the Next.js project root.
2. Add these environment variables in the Vercel project settings for Production (and Preview if those deployments need the database):
   - `DATABASE_URL`: the MongoDB Atlas connection string. Confirm the Atlas network access list allows connections from the deployment.
   - `SESSION_SECRET`: a unique random secret of at least 32 characters. Do not reuse the local development secret.
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: the same Google OAuth web client ID if Google sign-in is enabled. Add the deployed domain to the OAuth client's authorized JavaScript origins.
3. Deploy. Dependencies run `prisma generate` during installation and Vercel builds the Next.js app with `npm run build`.
4. In Vercel Project Settings → Domains, add `e-mind.lk` and optionally `www.e-mind.lk`. Follow the exact DNS records Vercel displays at the domain registrar, then wait for DNS verification and HTTPS provisioning.
5. Verify sign-in, student exam flows, admin quiz publishing/reattempts, and uploads on the deployed domain.

MongoDB Atlas must be reachable from Vercel, and MongoDB transaction support requires a replica set (Atlas provides this). Keep production credentials in Vercel environment variables; never commit `.env`.

## Product architecture

- `src/app/page.tsx` currently owns the interactive student workspace prototype and exam attempt state.
- `src/app/globals.css` contains the responsive visual system and mobile layout rules.
- The next production slice should move exam state into server actions/API routes backed by MongoDB and Prisma, with server-side deadline validation on every save and submit request.
- Authentication uses MongoDB-backed hashed credentials, signed HTTP-only sessions, role checks, and protected admin access.
- Google sign-in uses Google Identity Services in the browser and server-side ID-token verification. Set both Google client ID variables from `.env.example` before enabling it.
- Recommendation logic should be an injectable service: profile signals -> candidate resources -> ranking -> explanation. YouTube ingestion belongs behind a server-side API route so keys never reach the browser.
- AI marking should be asynchronous for short answers and essays, store rubric evidence and model version, and expose a teacher/admin review state before finalising disputed marks.

## Data model

The initial MongoDB contract is captured in `prisma/schema.prisma`. It covers users, student profiles, academic taxonomy, exams, questions, attempts, answers, results, recommendations, learning history, and performance analytics. The schema intentionally keeps AI evaluation metadata separate from the student answer so model output can be reviewed and re-run.

## Planned production modules

1. Password reset and account recovery flow.
2. Student onboarding/profile APIs and eligibility queries.
3. Admin exam/question management with secure uploads.
4. Server-backed autosave, attempt locking, and deadline enforcement.
5. Objective grading, rubric-based AI evaluation, result feedback, and performance recommendations.
